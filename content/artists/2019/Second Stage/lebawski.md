description: Lebawski is a deejay with early roots in hip hop and drum ‘n bass. As a weekly Decadance resident and founder of Moonday, he sees music as a unified language, crossing the borders between different styles and people. Having played a lot of extended sets and all nighters, Lebawski has quite some experience behind the booth for his age. So it was time for another step, and recently he founded the vinyl only label MUZI cartel, where the direction is more into minimalistic sounds and scapes. You’re in for a ride, that’s for sure. !
