description: Adrian started 5 years ago at H2O club and Decadance!, he rapidly was booked by Cirque Magique and became a Sondag resident for quite a time. His sound can be described as a twist between minimal and house. Loving the drum elements of music you can expect a rythmic workout while listening to his sets. He also found home at MUZI cartel 1 year ago and carefully curates together with Lebawski & Barbosa the newly born label. <br/><br/>"Deep with a funky touch"<br/>Laurent JoÃ«l alias Barbosa is a Ghent-based DJ. Laurent always had a passion for disco, funky house and 80s music. During his exchange project in Barcelona, where he played in several local clubs, he discovered the world of minimal, deep and micro house. As a part of MUZI cartel and with his own concept INFERNO he brings best of both worlds together.
